# Vault Configuration

- Set your variables in `scripts/env.sh`
- Run `00_fast_setup.sh`
- Get vault admin token.
  - <http://consul.pphan.hashidemos.io:8500/ui/dc1/kv/service/vault/admin-token/edit>
- Log in to Vault UI with admin token
  - <http://vault-0.pphan.hashidemos.io:8200/ui/>
- Test ldap login, db, and transit.
  - `./scripts/test_hr_cloud.sh`
- NOTE: If you want to run this script again, need to reload postgres container.

``` shell
ssh ubuntu@bastion.pphan.hashidemos.io
#--> Go to vault repo that you cloned
cd /tmp/vault-benchmark-perfstandbys/
#--> Stop and start container
*docker-compose down; docker-compose up -d postgres
```

# Vault Sample Configuration
code doesn't work well with two columns
``` go
cluster_name = "${namespace}-demostack"
storage "consul" {
  path = "vault/"
  service = "vault"
}
listener "tcp" {
  address       = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_cert_file = "/etc/vault.d/tls/vault.crt"
  tls_key_file  = "/etc/ssl/certs/me.key"
   tls-skip-verify = true
}
seal "awskms" {
  region = "${region}"
  kms_key_id = "${kmskey}"
}
telemetry {
  prometheus_retention_time = "30s",
  disable_hostname = true
}
api_addr = "https://$(public_ip):8200"
disable_mlock = true
ui = true

# Packer
[the components](#components)

I try to build as much as I can into my gold images and using Packer. This provides the following benefits:
- Consistent builds

--
- Faster deploy times

--
- Consistent images across various clouds
